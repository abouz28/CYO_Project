# CYO_Project
Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, occurs when customers stop doing business with a company or stop using a company's services. By being aware of and monitoring churn rate, companies are equipped to determine their customer retention success rates and identify strategies for improvement. We will use a machine learning model to understand the precise customer behaviors and attributes which signal the risk and timing of customer churn. In this project, I want to predict Telco customer churn based on their behavior. This dataset is taken from Kaggle website. I will be using logistic regression and Gradient Boosting to predict the Churn Value variable that helps in analysing accuracy,specificity,sensitivity.
